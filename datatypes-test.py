# Question 1: Numbers
# Create a program that calculates the sum of the square of two numbers. Assign the numbers 5 and 10 to variables and display the result.


# Question 2: Strings
# Extract and print the first three characters and the last three characters from the string:


# python
# Copy code
# text = "HelloPythonWorld"
# Question 3: Booleans
# Given the numbers x = 25 and y = 50, check if x is half of y. Print the result as a Boolean value.


# Question 4: Lists
# Create a list of integers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Add the value 60 to the list, remove 30, and replace the first element with 5. Print the final list.


# Question 5: Tuples
# Create a tuple with the elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Unpack the first two elements into variables a and b, and assign the rest of the elements to a list remaining. Print a, b, and remaining.


# Question 6: Dictionary
# Create a dictionary with keys "name", "age", and "country" and assign them values "Alice", 25, and "Canada". Update the "age" to 26 and add a new key "profession" with the value "Engineer". Print the updated dictionary.


# Question 7: Sets
# Given the sets:


# python
# Copy code
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
# Find and print the union, intersection, and difference (set1 - set2) of the sets.


# Question 8: Advanced Numbers
# Given the float number value = 123.456789, round it to 2 decimal places and convert it to an integer. Print both results.


# Question 9: Combining Data Types
# Create a dictionary where the keys are names ("John", "Doe", "Alice") and the values are tuples containing their respective ages and countries. For example, "John": (30, "USA"). Retrieve and print "Alice"'s country.


# Question 10: None Type
# Write a program that initializes a variable with None. Update the variable to hold the concatenation of two strings: "Data" and "Types". Print the updated value.
